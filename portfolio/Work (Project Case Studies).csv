Omotenashi HR (Pillar 1),Authentication Architecture Overhaul,"""External Azure dependency created critical failure risks and service latency.""","""Architected and built a new internal authentication system using Nest.js & JWT, decoupling entirely from Azure.""","""Ensured 100% service stability (independent of external failures) and significantly reduced auth latency.""","Nest.js, JWT, Architecture"
Omotenashi HR (Pillar 2),DevOps Migration (Serverless -> AWS SAM),"""Slow and complex deployments using the Serverless Framework hindered development velocity.""","""Migrated the entire AWS Lambda deployment pipeline to Amazon SAM, standardizing templates and leveraging AWS-native features.""","""Cut deployment time by XX% (e.g., 30%), simplified CI/CD, and sped up new developer onboarding.""","AWS SAM, Lambda, DevOps"
Omotenashi HR (Pillar 3),Core Web Vitals & SEO Optimization,"""Low Lighthouse SEO scores (in the 60s) were negatively impacting Google rankings and user acquisition.""","""Led a performance audit. Optimized Sveltekit SSR, implemented modern image formats (WebP), and code-splitted heavy JS bundles.""","""Boosted Lighthouse SEO score by 20+ points, directly contributing to improved organic traffic.""","Sveltekit, SSR, Performance"
Omotenashi HR (Pillar 4),Zero-Downtime Node.js Upgrade,"""Potential security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks from an outdated Node.js version (e.g., 14.x).""","""Meticulously planned and executed a zero-downtime migration (with full rollback plan) to Node.js 18.x across all services.""","""Achieved 100% security compliance and unlocked modern language features with zero incidents.""","Node.js, Risk Mgmt"
