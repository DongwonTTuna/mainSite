## Self Introduction

### User-Centered Development

Throughout 10 years of programming experience, I have always prioritized user experience. By thinking from the user's perspective rather than developer convenience, I create truly useful systems.

### Proactivity and Self-Initiative

Beyond basic school curriculum, I proactively learned practical technologies to become job-ready. Achieved A-rank on Paiza platform and continuously improved skills through practical projects.

### Responsibility

Understanding that web applications are the first touchpoint for customers, I pay attention to every detail from design to usability. I provide continuous improvements and support based on customer feedback after release.

### Customer-Oriented Thinking

Through 2 years of customer service experience, I developed the ability to think from the customer's perspective rather than my own, which enhances my end-user focused development approach.
